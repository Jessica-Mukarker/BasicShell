### **BasicShell**

---

#### **Description**

BasicShell is a simple command-line shell program built in C that simulates the functionality of a Unix shell. It provides basic shell operations such as running commands, handling input/output redirection, and supporting background and foreground processes. The project is designed to help understand the core concepts of shell operations, process management, and system calls in Unix-like operating systems.

With a focus on simplicity and clarity, BasicShell is a great learning tool for those looking to understand how shells work under the hood and interact with the operating system.

#### **Features**

- **Command Execution**: Execute user commands and display the output, just like a traditional shell.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: Supports both input (`<`) and output (`>`) redirection, allowing users to redirect streams to and from files.
- **Background and Foreground Processes**: Allows users to run processes in the background using `&` and handle foreground tasks.
- **Built Using C**: Written in C, the shell utilizes basic system calls to interact with the operating system.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to provide feedback when commands fail or are incorrectly entered.

#### **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**:
  - C (to simulate the functionality of a Unix shell)
  
- **System Calls**:
  - `fork()` (for creating child processes)
  - `exec()` (for executing commands)
  - `wait()` (for managing process execution)
  - `pipe()` (for handling piping between commands)
