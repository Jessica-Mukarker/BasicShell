# BasicShell
The C program implements a simple shell, starting with the main function. The shell reads input commands, parses them, and executes actions. Key functions include read_input, parse_input, and execute_command. The program includes a fork() function for handling multiple commands and uses system calls like execvp() and chdir() for external commands.
